# Relspec

It is IEEE sponsored project which targets to make a software reliability language which can predict the reliability of an embedded system based on a probabilistic model . In this sectio, I have made an API named RelSpec which will take any relspec file and generate the corresponding C file.(using flex and bison and c)
To Run:
gcc cmd.c
./a.out
